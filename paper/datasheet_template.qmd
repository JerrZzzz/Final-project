Extract of the questions from @gebru2021datasheets.

**Motivation**

1. *For what purpose was the dataset created? Was there a specific task in mind? Was there a specific gap that needed to be filled? Please provide a description.*
    - This dataset is created by Rohan Rao aiming to provide general public a readable dataset about the past races which F1 offical website does not provide where people can analyze driver's data after every race. 
2. *Who created the dataset (for example, which team, research group) and on behalf of which entity (for example, company, institution, organization)?*
    - This dataset is created by an individual called Rohan Rao who is on behalf of himself. 
3. *Who funded the creation of the dataset? If there is an associated grant, please provide the name of the grantor and the grant name and number.*
    - No one funded this dataset. Rohan Rao imported the dataset from Ergast Developer API which is for non-commercial purpose. 
4. *Any other comments?*
    - No

**Composition**

1. *What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent (for example, documents, photos, people, countries)? Are there multiple types of instances (for example, movies, users, and ratings; people and interactions between them; nodes and edges)? Please provide a description.*
	- The original dataset contained a lot of different files where every one of the file represents various thing. I will talk about the files that I used in my paper. All files displayed are inter-connected. For the qualifying file, circuitId is inter-connected with specific circuit information in the circuit file. raceId is inter-connected with specific race information in the race file. Every row represents a driver's lap time in a specific race. For example, Max verstappen achieved a final grid position of 1 in raceId 1230 with Q1, Q2, Q3 fastest lap time displayed. 
2. *How many instances are there in total (of each type, if appropriate)?*
	- There are raceId going from 1 to 1100. driverId going from 1 to 858. Position going from 1 to 28. and lap times below 3 minutes per lap. 
3. *Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set? If the dataset is a sample, then what is the larger set? Is the sample representative of the larger set (for example, geographic coverage)? If so, please describe how this representativeness was validated/verified. If it is not representative of the larger set, please describe why not (for example, to cover a more diverse range of instances, because instances were withheld or unavailable).*
	- The dataset does not contained all possible instances which more recent races are not included. However, the dataset had contained all possible qualifying results in the history. I can say that the dataset we used can represent almost all population in history. 
4. *What data does each instance consist of? "Raw" data (for example, unprocessed text or images) or features? In either case, please provide a description.*
	- It consist of raceId which is a number represent each race. DriverId used a number to represent all drivers. ConstructorId used numbers to represent the team that the driver is in at that race. Position represents the final grid position the driver is in. Q1, q2, q3 represents the driver's fastest lap time of each qualifying sections while those eliminated driver's lap time in further qualifying will represent with NA values. 
5. *Is there a label or target associated with each instance? If so, please provide a description.*
	- The label or target in my dataset is the lap time for q1, q2 and q3. Each of them containe a lap time each driver achieved in that specific qualifying session. 
6. *Is any information missing from individual instances? If so, please provide a description, explaining why this information is missing (for example, because it was unavailable). This does not include intentionally removed information, but might include, for example, redacted text.*
	- For those driver being eliminated from q1 and q2. They will have missing value to q2, q3 lap time and q3 lap time respectively. It is not intentionally removed but no value can appear in those areas because driver are not allow to take part in those qualifying sessions. 
7. *Are relationships between individual instances made explicit (for example, users' movie ratings, social network links)? If so, please describe how these relationships are made explicit.*
	- RaceId are interconnected in datasets. Race dataset described all races in F1 history. Every race had being addressed to a raceId where other datasets like qualifying will be using these raceId to identify the qualifying for that race. 
8. *Are there recommended data splits (for example, training, development/validation, testing)? If so, please provide a description of these splits, explaining the rationale behind them.*
	- Yes, we can split data for different circuits to validate our model and use a more recent data to test the fit of our model. 
9. *Are there any errors, sources of noise, or redundancies in the dataset? If so, please provide a description.*
	- By looking at the data and modeling them, we found that there is no error of measurement and redundancies in the dataset. There are a lot of factors can influence our model where it made the uncertainty of our model a bit high. But we expect the noises because of real life factors.ã€€
10. *Is the dataset self-contained, or does it link to or otherwise rely on external resources (for example, websites, tweets, other datasets)? If it links to or relies on external resources, a) are there guarantees that they will exist, and remain constant, over time; b) are there official archival versions of the complete dataset (that is, including the external resources as they existed at the time the dataset was created); c) are there any restrictions (for example, licenses, fees) associated with any of the external resources that might apply to a dataset consumer? Please provide descriptions of all external resources and any restrictions associated with them, as well as links or other access points, as appropriate.*
	- Our dataset is partly external. The circuit information, team information, Driver information are dependent on wikipedia. However, other information about races and the lap time for example that we used do not depend on ourside sources. The outside sources will not influence our model and the whole paper. The term and conditions are stated in the API website where we must not create any application which polls the API more than four times per second or more than 200 times per hour. 
11. *Does the dataset contain data that might be considered confidential (for example, data that is protected by legal privilege or by doctor-patient confidentiality, data that includes the content of individuals' non-public communications)? If so, please provide a description.*
	- No, all the data are considered public. Even though that the lap times are not published by the offical website of F1. But it does not offend any personal information. We can find all possiable information in F1tv. 
12. *Does the dataset contain data that, if viewed directly, might be offensive, insulting, threatening, or might otherwise cause anxiety? If so, please describe why.*
	- The dataset is not offernsive to any individual while not cause any public anxity. The dataset can be considered as recreational. 
13. *Does the dataset identify any sub-populations (for example, by age, gender)? If so, please describe how these subpopulations are identified and provide a description of their respective distributions within the dataset.*
	- No. There is no specific sub-populations being identified in dataset. 
14. *Is it possible to identify individuals (that is, one or more natural persons), either directly or indirectly (that is, in combination with other data) from the dataset? If so, please describe how.*
	- Yes, we are able to identify individual person in our dataset with the name presented and the sport itself. However, no personal information had revealed in the dataset. All information in the dataset are strongly relate to F1 motorsport. 
15. *Does the dataset contain data that might be considered sensitive in any way (for example, data that reveals race or ethnic origins, sexual orientations, religious beliefs, political opinions or union memberships, or locations; financial or health data; biometric or genetic data; forms of government identification, such as social security numbers; criminal history)? If so, please provide a description.*
	- No, races, sexual information, belief systems and so on are not stated in the dataset. Only the name, Birth date and nationality of the individual are stated. 
16. *Any other comments?*
	- No

**Collection process**

1. *How was the data associated with each instance acquired? Was the data directly observable (for example, raw text, movie ratings), reported by subjects (for example, survey responses), or indirectly inferred/derived from other data (for example, part-of-speech tags, model-based guesses for age or language)? If the data was reported by subjects or indirectly inferred/derived from other data, was the data validated/verified? If so, please describe how.*
